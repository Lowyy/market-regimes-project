This project aims to understand whether simple trading rules can be improved by conditioning them on market regimes, and whether those regimes can be identified reliably from observable financial data. The core idea is that markets do not behave uniformly over time: periods of calm, stress, or transition exhibit different statistical properties. If these regimes can be detected and predicted, even imperfectly, then trading strategies may be adapted accordingly.

Daily S&P 500 and VIX data are collected from Yahoo Finance and transformed into a comprehensive feature set capturing returns, volatility dynamics, momentum signals, and risk measures. These features are standardised and analysed in two parallel representations: the raw scaled space and a PCA-reduced space. Both representations are compared using inertia curves, silhouette scores, and explained variance to determine which better separates underlying market conditions.

Regime identification is carried out using both K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models. Their outputs are evaluated with silhouette, BIC, and AIC criteria, and the final choice between them is made empirically. Once regimes are assigned back to the full dataset, they are inspected to verify that they capture distinct behavioural phases of the market.

Supervised learning models are then trained to predict the next-day regime based on today’s features. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting are implemented and evaluated using two time-based walk-forward splits. A majority-vote ensemble is also used to stabilise the predictions. Performance is assessed using accuracy, balanced accuracy, F1 score, and AUC, supported by confusion matrices, ROC curves, and transition matrices.

The predicted regimes from the main split are finally used to drive three rule-based trading strategies: a simple regime-switching approach, a momentum strategy, and a more tuned strategy combining several market signals. These strategies are evaluated against a buy-and-hold benchmark using returns, volatility, Sharpe and Sortino ratios, and drawdowns
